## Introduction

[Artificial Bee Colony (ABC)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221498082_Artificial_Bee_Colony_ABC_Optimization_Algorithm_for_Solving_Constrained_Optimization_Problems) Algorithm is a swarm intelligence-based optimization algorithm inspired by the foraging behavior of honey bees. The algorithm simulates the collective intelligence of a bee colony in searching for the best food sources. In ABC, the bees are divided into three types: employed bees, onlooker bees, and scout bees. Each type of bee plays a specific role in the search process to find the optimal solution.

## Mathematical Formula

The Artificial Bee Colony Algorithm is based on the following mathematical formulas:

- **Position update:**
  ```
  v_ij = x_ij + ϕ_ij * (x_ij - x_kj)
  ```

- **Probability calculation:**
  ```
  p_i = fitness_i / sum(fitness)
  ```

- **Limit parameter:**
  ```
  limit = n * D
  ```

Where:
- `v_ij`: new position of the food source
- `x_ij`: current position of the food source
- `ϕ_ij`: random number in the range [-1, 1]
- `x_kj`: position of a randomly selected food source
- `p_i`: probability of selecting a food source
- `fitness_i`: fitness value of the i-th food source
- `n`: number of food sources
- `D`: dimension of the problem
- `limit`: maximum number of trials for a food source to be abandoned

### Explanation of the Formula

The Artificial Bee Colony Algorithm works by simulating the foraging behavior of honey bees. The bees search for the best food sources (solutions) by iteratively updating their positions based on the quality of the food sources.

## Pseudo Code

```
Initialize a population of food sources with random positions
Evaluate the fitness of each food source
while termination condition is not met:
    Employed Bee Phase:
        for each employed bee:
            Generate a new candidate solution
            Evaluate the fitness of the new solution
            Apply greedy selection between the current and new solution
    Calculate the probability values for the food sources
    Onlooker Bee Phase:
        for each onlooker bee:
            Select a food source based on the probability values
            Generate a new candidate solution
            Evaluate the fitness of the new solution
            Apply greedy selection between the current and new solution
    Scout Bee Phase:
        if any exhausted food source exists:
            Replace it with a new randomly generated food source
    Memorize the best food source found so far
```

### Explanation of the Pseudo Code

- **Initialization:** The algorithm starts by initializing a population of food sources with random positions in the search space. The fitness of each food source is evaluated.
- **Employed Bee Phase:** In this phase, each employed bee generates a new candidate solution by modifying its current position using the position update formula. The fitness of the new solution is evaluated, and a greedy selection is applied between the current and new solution, keeping the better one.
- **Probability Calculation:** The probability values for the food sources are calculated based on their fitness values using the probability calculation formula.
- **Onlooker Bee Phase:** In this phase, each onlooker bee selects a food source based on the probability values. It generates a new candidate solution, evaluates its fitness, and applies a greedy selection between the current and new solution.
- **Scout Bee Phase:** If any food source has reached the limit parameter without improvement, it is considered exhausted and is abandoned. The scout bee replaces the exhausted food source with a new randomly generated food source.
- **Best Solution Update:** The best food source found so far is memorized.
- **Termination:** The algorithm repeats steps 2-6 until a termination condition is met, such as reaching a maximum number of iterations or achieving a desired fitness value.
