## Introduction
[Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0965997813001853) is a nature-inspired optimization algorithm that mimics the social hierarchy and hunting behavior of grey wolves in a pack. The algorithm simulates the leadership hierarchy and hunting mechanisms of grey wolves to solve optimization problems. In GWO, the wolves are categorized into four types: alpha, beta, delta, and omega, representing the different levels of leadership and roles within the pack.

## Mathematical Formula
The Grey Wolf Optimizer algorithm is based on the following mathematical formulas:

```
Position update:
X(t+1) = X_p(t) - A · D

Distance calculation:
D = |C · X_p(t) - X(t)|

Coefficient vectors:
A = 2a · r1 - a
C = 2 · r2

Linearly decreased parameter:
a = 2 - t · (2 / Max_iter)
```

Where:
- `X(t)`: position vector of a grey wolf at iteration t
- `X_p(t)`: position vector of the prey at iteration t
- `A`, `C`: coefficient vectors
- `D`: distance between the grey wolf and the prey
- `a`: linearly decreased parameter from 2 to 0 over the course of iterations
- `r1`, `r2`: random vectors in the range [0, 1]
- `Max_iter`: maximum number of iterations

### Explanation of the Formula
The Grey Wolf Optimizer algorithm works by simulating the hunting behavior of grey wolves. The wolves update their positions based on the positions of the alpha, beta, and delta wolves, which represent the best solutions found so far.

The position update of a grey wolf is determined by the distance between the wolf and the prey (best solution). The coefficient vectors `A` and `C` introduce randomness and control the exploration and exploitation abilities of the wolves.

The linearly decreased parameter `a` balances the trade-off between exploration and exploitation. It starts with a value of 2 and gradually decreases to 0 over the course of iterations, allowing the wolves to transition from exploration to exploitation.

## Pseudo Code
```
Initialize a population of grey wolves with random positions
Initialize alpha, beta, and delta wolves as the three best solutions
while termination condition is not met:
    for each grey wolf:
        Update the position of the current wolf
        Update alpha, beta, and delta wolves
    Update a, A, and C
    Calculate the fitness of all grey wolves
    Update alpha, beta, and delta based on the best fitness values
```

### Explanation of the Pseudo Code
1. **Initialization**: The algorithm starts by initializing a population of grey wolves with random positions in the search space. The three best solutions are assigned as alpha, beta, and delta wolves.

2. **Position Update**: For each grey wolf, the algorithm updates its position based on the positions of alpha, beta, and delta wolves using the mathematical formulas described earlier.

3. **Coefficient Update**: The values of `a`, `A`, and `C` are updated in each iteration to control the exploration and exploitation behavior of the wolves.

4. **Fitness Calculation**: The fitness of all grey wolves is calculated based on the objective function being optimized.

5. **Leadership Update**: The alpha, beta, and delta wolves are updated based on the best fitness values obtained by the grey wolves.

6. **Termination**: The algorithm repeats steps 2-5 until a termination condition is met, such as reaching a maximum number of iterations or achieving a desired fitness value.

### Reasoning behind the Implementation
The Grey Wolf Optimizer algorithm is implemented in this way to effectively simulate the social hierarchy and hunting behavior of grey wolves. The key aspects of the implementation are:

- **Leadership Hierarchy**: The categorization of wolves into alpha, beta, delta, and omega represents the different levels of leadership and roles within the pack. This hierarchy guides the search process towards the best solutions.

- **Hunting Mechanism**: The position update of grey wolves is inspired by the hunting behavior of wolves in nature. The wolves update their positions based on the positions of the alpha, beta, and delta wolves, which represent the best solutions found so far.

- **Exploration and Exploitation**: The coefficient vectors `A` and `C` introduce randomness and control the exploration and exploitation abilities of the wolves. The linearly decreased parameter `a` balances the trade-off between exploration and exploitation over the course of iterations.

- **Fitness Evaluation**: The fitness calculation of grey wolves guides the search towards optimal solutions by identifying the best solutions in each iteration.
