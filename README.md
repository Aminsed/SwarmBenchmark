## Repository Structure

Each algorithm has its own dedicated folder, named after the algorithm's abbreviation (e.g., PSO, ACO, FA). Within each algorithm folder, you will find three subfolders:

- `CPP`: Contains the pure C++ implementation of the algorithm.
- `OMP`: Contains the OpenMP implementation of the algorithm for parallel processing.
- `CUDA`: Contains the CUDA implementation of the algorithm for GPU acceleration.
- `THRUST`: Contains the THRUST implementation of the algorithm for GPU acceleration.

Inside each subfolder, you will find the respective code files and a README file with instructions on how to compile and run the code.

## Getting Started

To get started with any of the algorithms, navigate to the desired algorithm's folder and choose the implementation you want to use (CPP, OMP, or CUDA). Follow the instructions provided in the respective README file to compile and run the code.

## Contributing

Contributions to this repository are welcome! If you have an implementation of a swarm intelligence algorithm that is not currently included, or if you want to improve an existing implementation, please submit a pull request. Make sure to follow the repository's structure and provide clear instructions on how to compile and run your code.
